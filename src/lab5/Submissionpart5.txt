I took all borrowing aspects out of the member class as SRP requires us to have a class only focus on 
one thing. Since the member class is focused on the information of the members the borrowing logic was moved.
I chose to put the borrowing functionality into BorrowingService because it interacts with both the book and member classes.
The borrowingService involves both members and books and so it is the best place to have this code.
An issue that I ran into was that it broke existing behavior so I had to update some of the files (mainly the test ones)
This is because too many files relied on the member class handling the borrowing function and created their own 
instances of members
